# GeoTruck Maps - Technical Notes

## Technology Stack

- **Backend Stack:** Node.js + Express
- **Mobile Stack:** React Native + Google Maps SDK
- **Routing Engine:** Google Routes API Advanced
- **API Integration:** RESTful communication between mobile and backend

## Core Technical Decisions

- Using Google Routes API Advanced for truck-specific routing (height, weight, axle restrictions)
- React Native for cross-platform mobile development (iOS + Android from single codebase)
- Express for lightweight backend API server
- Google Maps SDK for mobile map rendering and polyline display

## API Key Requirements

- Google Routes API Advanced key (backend)
- Google Maps SDK key (mobile - separate for iOS/Android)
